Delete the extra files to clean up the folder
Put the .pretty in the Libraries folder. Need to remap this and rename it Libraries. A Packages folder for footprints and a Symbols folder for   
Move the GND with the 9V battery connector and move text to the right
Use a power flag instead of the 3.3V 
Get rid of the short connectors between the GNDs and point them down
R3 resistor needs to be 500ohm
Remapping consist of removing it and then going and selecting it again
Anchor points in bottom left hand corner, move reference to bottom right corner
Add text to Tx that says D1 for digital pin 1
New section with just the LEDs 
Label some of the wires with net labels
One LED connected to the power plane (3.3V) connected to power flag
One for momentary and one for maintain 
Text next to the LEDs based on which color each one is - presentation on which color is which on Hardware Architecture Standards-2019 presentation in Drive
Additional LED that is red and lights up when the Rover E-stops. Plan is around 330ohm 
Fill the background of the symbol for ESP
F.Fab will make them as notes instead of silkscreen. Convert them to that so it won't show up on the board
Make the text as silkcreen for the names of the footprints
Pin numbers on the symbol needs to match the footprint
Change the numbers on the MOM switch so that they match the data sheet PCB layout
D6_SPST needs to replace the MOMSwitch_SPDT as the name
Change the slide switch via dimensions to be .06 inches and .12 inches
Text in the F.Fab layer saying where the on and the off positions of the slide switch are
SlideSwitch_SPST 
Change the vias on the MOM switch to .9mm and the outside to 1.8mm or around there 
On the toggle switch make the vias .15 outside and .08189 inside (inches)
Need a three position toggle switch in the schematic - SW_SPDTMSM is the symbol and connect both of the outsides to the same thing
Try to make two different layouts - 
BSS138PW.115 is the Mosfet for the transmitter
The symbol is Q_NMOS_GSD
Need to make the board for the receiver.
